# Week 2, Tuesday

##  Features

### *Cook, Serve, Delicious!*

Similarly to how orders are prepared in this game, we can make an instruction-execution minigame, giving the instructions to the pilot, obstructing his view, having him relay the instructions to the engineer to execute ASAP so that the pilot can see again, and that the ship is returned to a stable condition.
